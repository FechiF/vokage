        <strong>Instructions:</strong> To move up in the ninja world, you must
        earn a perfect score on each level. Think of it like training your jutsu
        — you’ve got to master it completely before advancing! You can practice
        as many times as you need — just like Naruto never gives up.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each level you pass, your character grows stronger and ranks up:
        <br />
        Genin → Chunin → Jonin → Hokage → Legendary Ninja
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep training, young shinobi, and see if you can reach Hokage status.
        Believe it!
